Express + TypeScript Server with TypeORM connecting to MySQL

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

Node.js will be used to execute the `index.js` file in the `dist` folder.

### `npm run dev`

Therefor our node application will be executed by nodemon, which transpiles typescript to javascript just-in-time when code changes happen.

Compiles all the TypeScript files to JavaScript using the `tsc` command.
